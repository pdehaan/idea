# A simple way to visualize Ideas

> ## A design system is an agreed upon set of principles and a living suite of modular, resuable parts. This includes standards around style, color, language and behavior. The system allows us to work smarter and innovate on products faster, while providing a more predictable user experience.

## Content Management (Eleventy)

## Design System (DS) Setup

**DS Structure (Default Structure)**

While IDEA is based on the Atomic model (atoms, molecules, organisms, tempaltes, pages) popularized by Brad Frost, we choose a structure that we believe would more familiar to developers -

    * Attributes (Tokens)
    * Elements (Molecules)
    * Patterns (Organisms)
    * Screens (Templates)
    * Apps / Prototypes (Pages)

**Get started**

- View and edit with live updates run `yarn content`
-

Adding system components

- Filename structure use the `*.html.md` extensions making easier to format components see `content/elements/sample.html.md` for an example.
